## Context

I threw this project together after finding my own need PowerDimmer. I initially tried LeDimmer. It works well enough, but it's abandoned, closed source and very out of date.

A fan of PowerToys I checked for an open issue and found [microsoft/PowerToys#13035](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/13035). I decided to write this to try and gain support and get this module added to PowerToys.
